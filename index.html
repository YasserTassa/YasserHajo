		<h1>
			HTML DOCUMETAION
		</h1>
		<section>
			<p>There are six different heading tags in HTML begin from <strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong> the bigger and most importnat  til <em>H<sub>6</sub></em> the smaller.</p>

			<p>
				Here my <em><b>HTML DOCUMENTATION</b></em> is my main headining so I use <strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong> for it any other subheading will be <em>H<sub>3</sub></em>.</p>

			<p>
				The first part over there talked about <em><b>HTML Headings</b></em> and contains additiional elements as the "B" tag which indicates bold text,there is also "i" tag used for <i>italic text</i> as you can notice the is "sub" and "sup" to indicate text<sub>sub</sub> and text<sup>sup</sup>,you will also come through horizontal <hr />rule and breakline tags<br />.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way I devided this section into three paragraph using the paragraph <b>P tag<p/>
			</p>

		<h3>
			Sematic HTML tags
		</h3>
		<section>
			<p>
			<strong>HTML </strong>contains semantic tags which are tags give you mental signs about there meaning and usage such as <strong>strong tag</strong> I used with <strong>HTML</strong>
			it indicates that this text has great importance;the <em>emphasis</em> is a semanic tag too,I already used it with the sub headings in the first pragrapph.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are also <b>insert,delete and strike tags</b> where delete <del>delets text</del>,insert <ins>text </ins> and strike <s>strike text</s>.
				<blockquote>
					The striked text shouldn't be deleted,like in discount offers.
				</blockquote>
